For example, it can be caused by recently replaced/launched replica instances from older backups and these replicas requiring substantial time to catch-up to the primary database instance and live transactions. This ReplicaLag may dwindle over time as catch-up occurs. Another example could be that the transaction velocity able to be achieved on the primary database instance is higher than the replication process or replica infrastructure is able to match. This ReplicaLag may grow over time as replication fails to keep pace with the primary database performance.  Finally, the workload may be bursty throughout different periods of the day/month/etc. that result in occasional ReplicaLag to fall behind.  Your team should investigate which possible root cause has contributed to high ReplicaLag for the database, and possibly change the database instance type or other characteristics of the workload to ensure data continuity on the replica matches your requirements.<br><br><b></b><b>Additional Resources</b><br><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PostgreSQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.html"" target=""_blank"">Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL</a><br><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_MySQL.Replication.html"" target=""_blank"">Working with MySQL replication in Amazon RDS</a><br><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_MySQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.html"" target=""_blank"">Working with MySQL read replicas</a>"

This provides automatic failover, improve performance, and enhances data durability. In a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary DB instance is synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to a standby replica to provide data redundancy and minimize latency spikes during system backups. Running a DB instance with high availability enhances availability during planned system maintenance. It can also help protect your databases against DB instance failure and Availability Zone disruption.<br><br>For more information, see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZSingleStandby.html"" target=""_blank"">Multi-AZ DB instance deployments</a>.<br><br><b>Source</b><br>AWS Config Managed Rule: rds-multi-az-support<br><br><b>Alert Criteria</b><br>Yellow: An RDS DB Iistance does not have a Multi-AZ replica configured.<br><br><b>Recommended Action</b><br>Turn on Multi-AZ deployment when you create an RDS DB instance.<br><br><b>Additional Resources</b><br><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZSingleStandby.html"" target=""_blank"">Multi-AZ DB instance deployments</a>"
